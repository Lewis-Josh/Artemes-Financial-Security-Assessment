Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company. They needed to modernize their operations by using cutting edge software and the best security practices available for their web application. Upon investigation, I determined a number of outdated dependencies in their Spring Boot application. For Artemis, because they are dealing with consumer information, it is required by law that they maintain the utmost security standards available. The challenge for this client was their usage of outdated software / dependencies that posed various security concerns, filtering through false positives flagged by the Maven plugin, took a great deal of time and effort. After refactoring the code, I implemented a secure hashing algorithm (SHA-256) alongside an advanced encryption method (AES-GCM-256) which is secure against even quantum level attacks. Additionally, I updated dependencies and implemented a security certificate to use for HTTPS / SSL Protocols. After refactoring the code and updating dependencies, I ran the vulnerability assessment again to determine no new vulnerabilities had been created or existed. These cryptography methods, alongside the certificate generation are standard security procedures when dealing with sensitive information. From this assignment, the key takeaways are the cryptography methods as well as secure information handling that are vital to any business or institution.
